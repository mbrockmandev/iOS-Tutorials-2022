 The observer pattern lets one object observe changes on another object. It involves three types:
 
 (1) The **subscriber** is the "observer" object and receives updates.
 
 (2) The **publisher** is the "observable" object and sends updates.
 
 (3) The **value** is the underlying object that's changed.
