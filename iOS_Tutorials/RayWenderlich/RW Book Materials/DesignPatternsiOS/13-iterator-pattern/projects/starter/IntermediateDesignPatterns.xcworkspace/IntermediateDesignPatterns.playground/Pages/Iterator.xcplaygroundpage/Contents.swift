 The Iterator Pattern provides a standard way to loop through a collection. This pattern involves two types:
 
 1. The Swift `IteratorProtocol` defines a type that can be iterated using a `for in` loop.
  
 2. The **iterator object** is the type you want to make iterable. Instead of conforming to `IteratorProtocol` directly, however, you can conform to `Sequence`, which itself conforms to `IteratorProtocol`. By doing so, youâ€™ll get many higher-order functions, including `map`, `filter` and more, for free.
